Early treatment for the flu can prevent complications, and recovering at home allows you to avoid unnecessary expenses.

 Once you’ve healed, it's not worth worrying about things like missed work or credit card payments because you're feeling better soon.
 
You could always opt for a luxurious vacation to repay your emergency fund"
